## About
I try to understand how humans and other animals achieve their goals through planning and hard work, usually from the perspective of control theory.
<br>
I'm currently a PhD candidate with [Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) and [Michael J. Frank](https://www.lnccbrown.com/), and an honorary lab member with [Matthew Nassar](https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/).
