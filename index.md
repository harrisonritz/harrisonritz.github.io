## About
I try to understand how humans and other animals achieve their goals through planning and hard work, often from the perspective of control theory, using computational modelling and neuroimaging.
<br><br>
I completed my MSc at University of Western Ontario with [Ingrid Johnsrude](https://sites.google.com/site/johnsrudeconchlab/home) and my PhD at Brown University with [Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/), [Michael J. Frank](https://www.lnccbrown.com/), and [Matthew Nassar](https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/) (honorary).
<br><br>
I am currently a C.V. Starr Postdoctoral Fellow at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute with [Jonathan Cohen](https://ncclab.princeton.edu/) and [Nathaniel Daw](https://dawlab.princeton.edu/).
