## About
I use control theory to understand how humans and other animals work to achieve their goals.
<br>
I'm currently a PhD student with [Amitai Shenahv](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) and [Michael Frank](https://www.lnccbrown.com/), and an honorary lab member with [Matthew Nassar](https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/).
