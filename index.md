### I'm interested in how we achieve our goals through planning and cognitive control, usually from the perspective of optimal control theory.

My research combines behavioral experiments (e.g., psychophysics, naturalistic planning), brain imaging (e.g., fMRI, OP-MEG, collaborations with iEEG & ephys), and computational modelling (e.g., evidence accumulation, state space inference, inverse optimal control) to understand how we control our thoughts and actions.

I completed my BSc at Queen's University and my MSc at University of Western Ontario, working with [Ingrid Johnsrude](https://sites.google.com/site/johnsrudeconchlab/home). During my PhD at Brown University I worked with [Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/), [Michael J. Frank](https://www.lnccbrown.com/), and [Matthew Nassar](https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/).

I am currently a C.V. Starr Associate Research Scholar at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, working with [Jonathan Cohen](https://ncclab.princeton.edu/) and [Nathaniel Daw](https://dawlab.princeton.edu/).
